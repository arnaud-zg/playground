# usePageTransition

## Introduction

Following the presentation of Jake Archibald on the Google I/O 2022, I was 
really excited to document transition API. Unlike mobile application 
development, creating a nice transition from one page to another implies to
use an external library such as framer or have a in-depth knowledge about css 
animation and keyframes.

From what I have experimented, document transition API provides modularity on 
the code. This means the animations are added to an application as a plugin and
can be easily removed at any time. Moreove, it is very easy to use and have a 
fade or zoom animation. And the icing on the cake, it's customizable with css
animation and keyframes.

## Transition Status

Given that the page transition API is still in the experimental phase, to get 
started with element transitions today, you need to enable the API via
**chrome://flags/#document-transition**.

## No Transition

No transition on this list of images.

## Fade In / Fade Out

The default transition is a cross-fade from the image list to the selected 
image. The transition is made based on the "screenshot" made on the outgoing and 
incoming pages. The outgoing elements animates from 
`opacity: 1` to `opacity: 0`, whereas the incoming elements animates from 
`opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`, creating a cross-fade.

## Translate with pseudo-element selectors



If you want to go further and use custom transition. Each element could be 
targeted using CSS pseudo selectors, it means that all the animation are driven
by CSS. Here are the pseudo selectors provided by Page Transition API.

```
::page-transition-container(root)
::page-transition-image-wrapper(root)
::page-transition-outgoing-image(root)
::page-transition-incoming-image(root)
```

## Transition with CSS properties


So far, we've been able to animate the whole page, but state transitions 
often need to animate things independently. To do this you can use the property
`page-transition-tag`. On the same principle, the transition is made based on 
the "screenshot" made on the outgoing and inconming element. You can see a 
translate and zoom effect.

## Transition with DOM manipulation


Another way to animate things independently is to dynamically set the value 
on the `element.style.pageTransitionTag` with Javascript.
